This package provides CMC model support for Cedar EDA,
but is not part of the Cedar EDA platform. Instead, it redistributes
a number of model files provided by the Compact Modeling Coalition (CMC).
Each model is provided under its own license terms.

To the extent that copyrightable changes were made during the repackaging
process, they are hereby made available, at your option, under either
1) The terms of upstream license applicable to the modified files, or
2) The MIT license (see LICENSE.MIT for license terms)
